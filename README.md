# Ground Control [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/Bernie-2016/ground-control.png?label=status-ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/Bernie-2016/ground-control)

Ground Control is the campaign's central platform for creating, managing, and increasing turnout to events. It contains several key tools used every day by campaign volunteers and staff:

* An administrative interface for editing and approving events
* An event creation tool
* Call and email tools for event hosts to increase turnout
* A constituent lookup tool for administrative use
* A constituent event dashboard to allow uploading of data files for review by our data team

## Getting Started

### OS X

In OS X, we currently run everything locally using a Procfile and node-foreman. To get started, install [Node.js 5.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/stable/) and [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Then clone this repository and cd into ground-control. Then do the following:

```
npm install
./setup-osx
```

Then you should be able to start Ground Control on `http://localhost:3000` with

`npm run dev`

### Windows & Linux

On Linux, follow the same directions as OS X above, but substitute `./setup-linux` for the equivalent OS X script.

You will also need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed to provide your database.
