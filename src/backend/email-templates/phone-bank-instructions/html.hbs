  Dear {{volunteerName}},

  Here's what you need to do to get ready:
</p>

<b>2. <a href="https://organize.berniesanders.com/call/{{callAssignmentId}}">Invite Bernie supporters near you to attend your event</a></b><br>
The calling tool in the link above will connect you with other volunteers who live close to your event. You can also share this link with your friends if you'd like them to help you invite more people to your event. There are lots of Bernie volunteers out there — we have around hundreds of thousands volunteers signed up so far — so there are probably many Bernie volunteers in your area whom you have yet to meet.
