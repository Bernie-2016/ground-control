  Dear {{volunteerName}},
</p>
<p>
  Thanks for registering your event -- it will show up soon on <a href="http://map.berniesanders.com">map.berniesanders.com</a> so others can find it.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The next step is to reach out to other Bernie supporters near you and invite them to attend!</b> The campaign regularly emails local supporters with links to happenings in their neighborhood, but the best way to get folks to your event is for you to invite them directly. More people will say yes to a personal call from you than an email from us!
</p>
<p>
  Here’s how it works. We’ve built a calling tool that provides you with the phone numbers of Bernie supporters near your event. It also has an easy way to RSVP them while you’re talking with them on the phone.

  If we want Bernie to win, we have to get as many people as possible involved in our movement. You’ve taken a huge step by posting an event. Now we need you to help us get people there! You can also share this link with your friends if you'd like them to help you invite more people to your event.
</p>
<p>
  It's also a good idea to <a href="https://organize.berniesanders.com/events">log in and check your event details</a>. In particular, double check that your address and the event time are correct. You’ll use the the same email and password to login that you used to create the event. If you have any questions, just email <a href="mailto:help@berniesanders.com">help@berniesanders.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you so much for volunteering for Bernie. It is an honor to work alongside you in this movement.
